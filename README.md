# ScrabbleWords
In my efforts to learn python, one of the best examples I’ve seen is this program which determines valid 
scrabble words, including their score.  The code illustrates many Python features - large scale text 
manipulation, lists, dictionaries, and functions, io.  The speed with which it produces results while 
looking through a fairly large list (267,000) of words is slick to see. It was part of a video series 
on O’Reilly Books, presented by Jessica McKellar.
